    CRITICAL MISSION: Compute π using the Chudnovsky algorithm with these exact constraints:

    {assignment}

    You MUST implement:
    • Arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic (no float, no decimal)
    • Binary splitting for the series summation (recursive divide-and-conquer)
    • Integer square root via Newton-Raphson (for √10005)
    • Full series: π = 426880 × √10005 / S, where S = Σ[k=0→n] term(k)
    • term(k) = (6k)! × (545140134k + 13591409) / ((3k)! × (k!)³ × (-640320)^{3k})
    • At least 100 correct decimal places (aim for 200+)
    • Progress bar using print() or tqdm-style output
    • Final output: π as string with 100+ digits
    • Compare first 100 digits with math.pi
    • Compute sin(π) using Taylor series on your big-int π → must be < 1e-90
    • Print timing and digits/second

    This is used by actual world-record π computations. Do not disappoint.

  expected_output: |
    A complete, runnable, pure-Python script that:
    - Prints "Chudnovsky π Computation (Pure Integer Arithmetic)"
    - Shows progress during binary splitting
    - Outputs π to 100+ digits
    - Reports: time taken, digits computed, digits/second
    - Proves correctness with |sin(π)| < 1e-90
    - Ends with: "π computed successfully to X decimal places"
