Generate Drafts: Use all three sales_agent tools to produce three distinct email drafts. Do not proceed until all drafts are ready.\n2. Evaluate and Select: Critically review the drafts and select the one that is most likely to get a positive response. You may call the tools multiple times if needed to improve results.\n3. Handoff for Sending: Provide ONLY the selected email draft to the 'Email Manager' agent. The Email Manager will format it and send it.\n\nRules:\n- All drafts must come from the sales_agent tools — do not write any drafts yourself.\n- Only hand off ONE email to the Email Manager — never more than one.\n- Ensure the email is clear, professional, and engaging.\n\"\"\"\n\nsales_manager = Agent(\n    name=\"Sales Manager\",\n    instructions=sales_manager_instructions,\n    tools=tools,\n    handoffs=handoffs,\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\"\n)\n\nmessage = \"Send a cold sales email addressed to 'Dear CEO' from Alice\"\n\nwith trace(\"Automated SDR Workflow\"):\n    result = await Runner.run(sales_manager, message,max_turns=20)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-09T12:34:20.374404Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-09T12:34:20.374663Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-09T12:35:50.553886Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-09T12:34:20.374643Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-09T12:35:50.552659Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
