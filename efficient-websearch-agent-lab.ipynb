It autonomously breaks down tasks and employs tools like web browsing and file management. However, it faces challenges like tendency to get stuck in loops, hallucinate information, and incur high operational costs due to reliance on paid APIs. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoGPT?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Kruti** is a multilingual AI agent developed by Ola Krutrim, designed to perform real-world tasks such as booking taxis and ordering food by integrating directly with various online services. It is notable for its ability to understand and respond in multiple Indian languages. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruti?utm_source=openai))\n\n**AWS Kiro** is an AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) introduced by Amazon Web Services. It employs intelligent agents to break down project prompts into structured components, enabling more effective implementation, testing, and change tracking. Key features include automatic project planning, support for Model Context Protocol (MCP), steering rules for AI behavior, and ad-hoc agentic chat for various tasks. ([techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/aws-launches-kiro-an-agentic-ai-ide-to-end-the-chaos-of-vibe-coding?utm_source=openai))\n\n**ToolBrain** is a flexible reinforcement learning framework for agentic tools, designed to ease the training of agents in utilizing tools through flexible reinforcement learning. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00023?utm_source=openai))\n\n**AlphaEvolve** is an evolutionary coding agent developed by Google DeepMind, aiming to autonomously discover and refine algorithms through a combination of large language models and evolutionary computation. It is designed as a general-purpose system, unlike domain-specific predecessors like AlphaFold or AlphaTensor. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaEvolve?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Manus** is an autonomous AI agent developed by Butterfly Effect Technology, designed to independently execute complex real-world tasks without continuous human supervision. It is described as one of the first fully autonomous AI agents capable of independent reasoning, dynamic planning, and autonomous decision-making. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_%28AI_agent%29?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Simpliflow** is a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed for the rapid development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting ease of use and extensibility. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10675?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Jules** is an AI-powered coding agent developed by Google, built on the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. It is designed not only for professional developers but also for casual users interested in automation, app creation, or web design—even without programming experience. Jules is accessible via Google Labs with a free introductory tier for hobby use, and Pro and Ultra tiers offering significantly higher capacities for professionals and enterprise-scale needs. ([tomsguide.com](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/googles-powerful-ai-coding-agent-jules-is-now-available-to-everyone-heres-why-its-not-just-for-developers?utm_source=openai))\n\n**OpenAI Codex** is a developer agent that has been integrated across multiple development environments, including GitHub, terminals, web interfaces, and IDEs like VS Code and Cursor. This integration allows developers to engage with Codex directly in their existing workflow environments using their ChatGPT accounts, ensuring seamless state management between local and cloud-based activities. ([itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/business/business-strategy/openais-codex-developer-agent-just-got-a-big-update?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Google's Gemini API** has introduced improved support for structured outputs, notably through the integration of JSON Schema. This update simplifies the development of multi-agent AI systems by ensuring AI-generated responses conform to consistent schemas, which is crucial for tasks like data extraction and seamless agent-to-agent communication. ([androidcentral.com](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-to-use-the-gemini-api-in-multi-agent-workflows?utm_source=openai))\n\n**$Agent^2$** is a novel agent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated reinforcement learning agent design through intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms natural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive, high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13368?utm_source=openai))\n\n**AutoAgent** is a fully-automated and highly self-developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through natural language alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: Agentic System Utilities, LLM-powered Actionable Engine, Self-Managing File System, and Self-Play Agent Customization module. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05957?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese tools represent the forefront of AI agent development, each contributing unique capabilities to the evolving landscape of autonomous AI systems.
