This means their quantum states are linked, even when the particles are separated.\n\n3. **Superposition**: Before measurement, entangled particles exist in a superposition of states. For example, if we have two entangled particles, Particle A and Particle B, we cannot say where each particle is or what state they are in until a measurement is made.\n\n4. **Measurement**: When we measure the state of one of the entangled particles, it 'collapses' its superposition to a specific state. Importantly, this measurement instantaneously determines the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them.\n\n5. **Instantaneous Effect**: If Particle A is measured and found to be in a certain state (e.g., spin up), Particle B will instantaneously take on the opposite state (e.g., spin down), even if it is light-years away. This seems to defy classical notions of locality and suggests a deeper level of connection.\n\n6. **No Classical Communication**: While entangled particles seem to communicate, they do so in a way that does not allow for faster-than-light communication. The outcomes are inherently random, and no useful information is transmitted through the entangled states.\n\n### Real-World Analogy\n\nImagine a pair of gloves – one left glove and one right glove. If you place both gloves in separate boxes and send one box to New York and the other to Los Angeles, you don’t know which box contains which glove.\n\n1. **Initial State**: Before you open the boxes, each box represents a superposition of left or right glove.\n\n2. **Checking One Box**: As soon as you open the box in New York and find, say, a right glove, you immediately know that the box in Los Angeles must contain the left glove.\n\n3. **Instant Knowledge**: This knowledge happens instantly, regardless of the distance between the two boxes. However, you cannot control which glove is in the New York box (it's random until you check), similar to how measurement of one entangled particle reveals the state of the other.\n\nThis analogy captures the essence of quantum entanglement, emphasizing the correlated nature of the states despite the distance, but also the randomness of the outcomes when you're measuring.\n\nTERMINATE\nLLM received user: Quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum mechanics where pairs or groups of particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them.

The outcomes are inherently random, and no useful information is transmitted through the entangled states.\n\n### Real-World Analogy\n\nImagine a pair of gloves – one left glove and one right glove. If you place both gloves in separate boxes and send one box to New York and the other to Los Angeles, you don’t know which box contains which glove.\n\n1. **Initial State**: Before you open the boxes, each box represents a superposition of left or right glove.\n\n2. **Checking One Box**: As soon as you open the box in New York and find, say, a right glove, you immediately know that the box in Los Angeles must contain the left glove.\n\n3. **Instant Knowledge**: This knowledge happens instantly, regardless of the distance between the two boxes. However, you cannot control which glove is in the New York box (it's random until you check), similar to how measurement of one entangled particle reveals the state of the other.\n\nThis analogy captures the essence of quantum entanglement, emphasizing the correlated nature of the states despite the distance, but also the randomness of the outcomes when you're measuring.\n\nTERMINATE'\nStatus: ONLINE\nCapabilities:\n - Text Processing\n - Command Execution\n - Context Awareness\nAwaiting next instruction...\nLLMAgent responded: TERMINATE\nLLM responded to SimpleAgent: TERMINATE\n##################################################################################################################################\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":95},{"cell_type":"code","source":"await runtime.stop()\nawait runtime.close()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.721384Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.722358Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.726922Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.722330Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.726031Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":96},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from autogen_core.models import ModelInfo\n\nclass Player1Agent(RoutedAgent):\n    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:\n        super().__init__(name)\n        model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=1.0)\n        self._delegate = AssistantAgent(name, model_client=model_client)\n\n    @message_handler\n    async def handle_my_message_type(self, message: Message, ctx: MessageContext) -> Message:\n        text_message = TextMessage(content=message.content, source=\"user\")\n        response = await self._delegate.on_messages([text_message], ctx.cancellation_token)\n        return Message(content=response.chat_message.content)\n    \nclass Player2Agent(RoutedAgent):\n    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:\n        super().__init__(name)\n        model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",api_key=secret_value_0,temperature=1.0,\n            model_info=ModelInfo(vision=False, function_calling=False, json_output=False, family=\"gemini\", structured_output=False))\n        self._delegate = AssistantAgent(name, model_client=model_client)\n\n    @message_handler\n    async def handle_my_message_type(self, message: Message, ctx: MessageContext) -> Message:\n        text_message = TextMessage(content=message.content, source=\"user\")\n        response = await self._delegate.on_messages([text_message], ctx.cancellation_token)\n        return Message(content=response.chat_message.content)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.728260Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.728627Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.747111Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.728598Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-21T08:55:32.746078Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":97},{"cell_type":"code","source":"JUDGE = \"\"\"You are an expert judge for Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.\n\nRules:\nScissors cuts Paper\nPaper covers Rock\nRock crushes Lizard\nLizard poisons Spock\nSpock smashes Scissors\nScissors decapitates Lizard\nLizard eats Paper\nPaper disproves Spock\nSpock vaporizes Rock\nRock crushes Scissors\n\nThe players have made these choices:\n\"\"\"\n\nclass  RPSLSAgent(RoutedAgent):\n    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:\n        super().__init__(name)\n        model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0.7)\n        self._delegate = AssistantAgent(name, model_client=model_client)\n\n    @message_handler\n    async def handle_my_message_type(self, message: Message, ctx: MessageContext) -> Message:\n        instruction = (\"You are playing Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.\\n\" \"Respond with exactlyily ONE of these words (exact spelling, lowercase):\\n\"\n            \"rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock\")\n        msg = Message(content=instruction)\n        \n        p1 = AgentId(\"player1\", \"default\")\n        p2 = AgentId(\"player2\", \"default\")\n        \n        resp1 = await self.send_message(msg, p1)\n        resp2 = await self.send_message(msg, p2)\n        \n        result = f\"Player 1: {resp1.content.strip().lower()}\\nPlayer 2: {resp2.content.strip().lower()}\\n\"\n        judgment_prompt = f\"{JUDGE}{result}Who wins?
